##project-boilerplate

**Description**: Node Boilerplate for my [freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com "freecodecamp") projects

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
User Story: I can remove stocks.
User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
